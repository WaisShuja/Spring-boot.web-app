# Spring-boot.web-app
Hi I'm Wais Shuja.
I'm currently working on this repository (Spring Boot web application for the Trust's Sport products).
Ask me anything if you need to know about this application.

To run and discover what this application is about, these steps should be followed:

1. To use this application, we need to run it on any IDE but with Tomcat server.
2. User is going to register and the data will go to MySQL Database. So having MySQL workbench and 'trust' database(having two tables, products and user, inside databse are needed).

3. User can go to Search page to search for products. For example: water,protein, chocolate, and etc.
4. User can go to Login page and register new user by submitting a full form.
5. The form use JSR-380 validations. So bad data are not allowed.
6. User can log in by using a registered username. once user is loged in, user can log out as well.
